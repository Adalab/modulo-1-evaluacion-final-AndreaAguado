# Module # 1 - Final evaluation exercise

Hi! I'm Andrea Aguado :) and this repository was made to complete the final exercise of the Module 1 at the Adalab programming course.
This exercise is meant to show my newly acquired skills in both **HTML and CSS** ğŸ˜Š
I parted from a pre-made Started Kit that included pretty much everything needed to create the proyect, like an HTML template engine, the SASS preprocessor and a local server and much more.

In the Kit there are 3 types of files and folders:

- The files that are loose in the repository root, such as gulpfile.js, package.json.... They are the configuration of the project and we do not need to modify them.
- The `src/` folder: are the files of our web page, such as HTML, CSS, JS...
- The `public/` and `docs/` folders, which are automatically generated when we start the project. Kit reads the files inside `src/`, processes them and generates them inside `public/` and `docs/`.

For this first evaluation I had to work with the contents of the `src/` folder, making the HTML and SCSS my own by coding from scratch ğŸ’ª.
